My name is Abner Lago and my pronouns are **she/her**. I study web development since 2018 and I'm always looking for new ways to improve. I'm currently coursing the high school integrated to a technical course of Internet Informatics and also coursing the LaunchBase Bootcampo at [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br).
