### Hey there, welcome to my Github profile 👋

My name is Naomi Lago and my pronouns are **she/her**. I study web development since 2018 and I'm always looking for new ways to improve. I'm currently coursing the high school integrated to a technical course of Internet Informatics and also coursing the LaunchBase Bootcampo at [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br).

🌱 I’m currently learning **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **React.js** for work and **PHP** just for fun.
